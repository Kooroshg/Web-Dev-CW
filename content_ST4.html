<h2 style="text-align: center;"><u>Current state of Education:</u></h2>
<p>The biggest challenges facing education today are as follows; the unfortunate low quality of human resources as
    well as the need to adapt to the rapidly changing digital world,
    <br>Moreover, The discrepancy between classroom learning and the reality of the outside world, and the transformation
    brought by new technologies and the pros and cons it hold on education.
    <br>Below are other organizations striving to bring forward equal learning opportunities to underprivileged children.
</p>
<!-- Paragraph with all my text as well as images of the organisations -->
<p><u>CARE:</u>
    <br>CARE is an international humanitarian organization fighting global poverty.
    <br>They have been working to increase access to quality education for children who have been marginalized, in
    particular young girls who live in conflicted ridden homes.
    <br>"We put girls at the center of our programs and build a supportive environment for them in the community and at
    school. At the individual level,
    <br>CARE helps girls develop their academic competencies alongside leadership and life skills, raising their
    confidence and voices. "
    <br>CARE also manages to give an astonishing 90% of their resources to support the abolition of poverty with less
    than 10% going to administrative and fundraising costs.

<span><u>Edify:</u>
<br>Edify is an organization that began its run by supporting African and South American countries
<br>such as Ghana and the Dominicon Republic by providing them loan capital for the production of low-fee independent
schools.
<br>They also strive to ensure students at these schools are given technology to further enhance their ways of learning
<br>Which in their article they believe has become a necessity for employment.
<br>The issue they attempt to resolve is that the children in these rural areas lack access to electricity therefore
making the use of technology much more difficult.
<br>By ensuring students have a center to learn and grow, they are also able to provide the support for electricity and
easy access to electronic devices where these students can enhance their learning.
<br>"Classrooms in Liberia, Peru, and Northeast India can now access the same technology as ones in America, Canada, and
Australia.
<br>Students can increase their learning potential, strengthen their employability, and be equipped to break the cycle
of poverty in their families, communities, and nations."

<p><u>UNICEF:</u>
    <br>For over 75 years, UNICEF has been at the forefront in protecting children by ensuring more of them are
    vaccinated, educated, and protected. They operate the largest humanitarian warehouse on Earth.
    <br>When it comes to Education, UNICEF works day in and day out, in some of the toughest places to protect the rights
    of children and safeguard their futures.
    <br>They firmly believe that "Education boosts economic growth and reduces poverty and inequality."
    therefore it's important to note that we must strive to ensure access for all especially since education is the
    first service to be suspended and the last to be restored during a crisis.
    <br>UNICEF helps children enhance skills to cope with the trauma of the crisis and supplies them with spaces of
    learning that are safe, child-friendly, and equipped with water and sanitation facilities.
    Their work also ensures it's at maximum efficiency by training teachers, supplying learning materials, and supporting
    Governments to reduce the risk of disaster in low-income areas.

<span><u>Global Partnership For Education:</u>
<br>Global Partnership For Education strive to provide education to low-income countries and aim for every girl and boy
to be able to get 12 years of quality education plus one year of preschool.
<br>GPE works close with 90 partner countries and has mobilized $11 Billion US dollar for education.
<br>One of their articles prioritizes motivation for teachers in low-income contexts; since they state that "In the next
14 years, almost 26 million teachers will need to be recruited just to provide every child with a primary education".
<br>Striving for better teachers who are qualified and show passion for ensuring that each child is shaped to be their
own strong, smart, and aspiring individual once they leave school.
<br>GPE uses a teacher motivation diagnostic tool and the themes that emerged are; support, beliefs, and other challenges.
Teachers need to be supported so that they can teach at their best.
beliefs that students' intelligence and ability are fixed are a common issue amongst a minority of teachers, GPE aims
to help teachers steer from this mindset so that students can learn and grow in a supportive environment.
